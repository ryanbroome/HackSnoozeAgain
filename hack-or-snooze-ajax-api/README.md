<h3>Hack or Snooze Again </h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>On my first attempt/submission I tried to use the solution like a patchwork program and it just ended up really confusing me. This go around I attempted to do it all myself. </p>
<p>My main strategy/goal was to review the API documentation and get the data requests working to and from the API through Javascript. Although all the visual elements and click events are not working exactly as I had hoped and I still get a bit confused by the overall scope of the project. I have added some functionality, but with many bugs. </p>
<p>Most of the time I was stuck hammering away trying to get the image src to update in real time if it's favorite or not on the main page when selected to be a favorite but couldn't get it to work.
<ul>I've tried
<li>selecting all images, checking to see if their ids are in user.favorites then changing their src if true</li>
<li>putting some sort of a "switch" in to write the markup with src of checked or unchecked</li>
<li>neither of these worked for me</li>
</ul>
It is pushing the data to the api but only refreshes on a full page refresh.</p>
<p>will be implementing error catching and allowing a user to update their account information or the further study items</p>
